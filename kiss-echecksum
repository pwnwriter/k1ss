# _e_xtended checksum - implements the 'variables' that so many in the
# kiss community seem to hate.

# You need one extra file in your package repo:
# - esources

# Which is essentially the same as your regular sources but with the
# previously valid package markers.

# It generates a 'sources' file from 'esources' with all of the variables
# removed, then uses 'kiss c' to generate a new checksums file.

# TODO: run some tests to ensure that all edge cases are accounted for.
